The 3-nt random sequence at the 5′-end of each sequencing read was removed, (except for the disome-seq for 3-AT treated yeast cells). The removed 3-nt sequence was added to the head of each read in the fastq format as the UMI, which can serve to remove PCR duplications generated during Illumina library preparation. The sequence identical to the 3′-sequencing adaptor (AGATCGGAAGAGCACACGTCT for read 1 in both disome-seq libraries and the control in Additional file 1: Fig. S8; TGGAATTCTCGGGTGCCAAG for monosome-seq and mRNA-seq libraries) was also trimmed in each read using cutadapt V1.16 (http://gensoft.pasteur.fr/docs/cutadapt/1.6/index.html).
